            <p class="letter__text text">Dear Cassia,</p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              Words can not explain how much you mean to me. The way you make me
              feel, the way you look at me, the way you smile. Never in my
              wildest dreams would I imagine me making this, let alone having
              ever talking to you again, especially on this level.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I know i've said that I had completely forgotton you before, left
              you in the past, never found any means to talk to you. It was
              better for me to leave you in the past as a coping mechanism and
              for me to find peace.But on the rare occassions that I would see
              you these past few years, there was this inexplicable feeling I
              got whenever i saw you. a feeling of seeing someone, especially
              your first love, someone who you shared everything with. Secrets,
              plans, how each others days went.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              It was crazy to think that someone like that had become a complete
              stranger. but one of those ones where you still had love for at
              the end of the day and wished nothing but the best because that's
              all you could really do
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              And I thought it would be the end of that. just a foggy memory of
              the past...
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-two">
            <p class="letter__text text">
              But somehow, someway, our paths crossed again, and I guess we have
              my dad to thank because of that. You hitting me up, coming to
              visit, I thought nothing of it, just you showing your respects. I
              know what was going through your head, maybe it was the same
              thoughts of mine. nothing but showing your support. But in a way,
              things worked out the way they did, with us and the group going
              for a walk, points where it was just me and you talking, I guess
              we were long overdue having a conversation together
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I remember it. When we were asked "why did you guys break up
              before?", and us not really having a straight answer, resurfaced
              so many memories in that instant about our past together. Mind
              you, I still thought you were in a relationship when this all went
              down, so it did feel kind of weird talking about our past like
              that. Me telling you about how you were the reason I started
              working out, you being kinda salty for not hitting you up on your
              birthday. I guess it was the perfect segway into us exchanging
              numbers
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              Thoughts of what if you didn't hit me up that one morning, asking
              me if I was up, how different would our lives be at this moment? I
              never thought much of our first text conversation to be honest
              with you. Thought it was just us catching up on each others lives.
              There was definitely a wall over me, protecting me from expecting
              what was going to come about talking to you again after all these
              years. But like I said before, it's like you reached out to me,
              back turned on you walking away from the past, grabbing my arm to
              get your attention. that moment when you messaged me, wondering if
              I was up, wishing i was with you at the hospital, was in a way you
              telling me "let's go, let's do this again, let's do this right"
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-three">
            <p class="letter__text text">
              And from there, it's all history, a story we'll tell to anybody
              who has an ear to listen. Facetiming all night till the sun came
              up just like how we were when we were younger. Seeing each other
              and going on what was clearly dates but couldn't really label it
              as that. I did however acknowledge that some the shit we were
              doing was lowkey romantic af
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I'd be lying if i said i wasn't afraid of what would come about us
              rekindling our relationship. Me wanting to take things slow to
              make sure we were both doing the right thing. But it didn't take
              long for me to realize that I did want you. I realized how much I
              had missed you after all that time we spent apart.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I guess we did take things slow in the sense of not talking to
              each other for 6 years doing our own things, experiencing and
              learning important life lessons that would inevitably draw us back
              to one another as two completely grown up individuals. That night
              when we kissed for the first time, how you first squeezed me so
              tightly, made me realize how much you wanted me and missed me.
              Made me realize that you were the one i wanted to call mine again
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              But after all of that I was still scared, remembering the past and
              fearing if history would repeat itself held me back. Getting
              advice from the outside just made me more confused, but once i set
              the outside noise aside and listened to what my heart was telling
              me, I knew I wanted you.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">And I haven't looked back since</p>
          </div>
          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-four">
            <p class="letter__text text">
              This past month has been amazing to say the least. the things
              we've done, the places we been to together, just being able to
              make all of these memories together with someone as special as
              you, has made me the happiest I've been in so long
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              It gives me a sense of security knowing you'd do as much for me as
              I would for you, even more. You continue to amaze me with all of
              the things you do not just for me, but the people that you love.
              You constantly go out of your way to make sure the ones in your
              circle are good and that's just one of the things I love about
              you. The fact that you would even drive all the way to Oshawa to
              just see me makes me know you're for real. Even going on our
              cottage trip with everyone, sharing a room with you, being
              comfortable as a couple in front of others.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              It just gives me pride to be able to call you all mine. Like how
              could somebody not want you? I guess we had to take that time
              apart to realize how much we missed and needed each other. I want
              to be the one you need to lie their shoulder on. I want to hear
              whatever you want to say, I'm all ears. I want to be there to
              celebrate with you when you're happy as well as when you're at
              your lowest. I don't want you to ever go through anything alone
              ever again.
            </p>
            <p class="letter_text text">You deserve the world and more.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-five">
            <p class="letter_text text">
              I know it is still earlier in our rekindled relationship, but with
              our history and the lessons we learned from these past few years,
              I can guarantee you I will always love you unconditionally. I
              can't imagine us ever arguing or fighting because I really am over
              the petty shit. I know you are too.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I just want to grow with you. That's what a relationship is really
              all about, bringing each other up and supporting one another in
              whatever they do. With you, I can honestly say I can do anything.
              There's so many things I want to do and I'm so happy that you're
              the one I'm going to be making all these memories with. I want you
              to be by my side through it all
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I'm so lucky to call you mine, again. It all still feels like a
              dream. I could never imagine us looking at each other the way we
              first did back then. Seeing me put a smile on your face, being
              able to hold you and kiss you, sharing the same bed with you, it
              all just feels right. It's all I ever wanted with you before. All
              of these memories of the past of us talking about how we are now
              just makes me think to myself that it's been a long time coming
              baby.

          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-six">
            <p class="letter__text text">
              Thinking of it now we are living in that one day we used to talk
              about and now, this 'one day' has turned into having a future
              together, living together, it's all so crazy to still think about.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I feel like if our past selves, the ones that were still together,
              constantly talking about the one day we would be doing the things
              we're doing together right now, going out in public, not being
              afraid of people seeing us, going on adventures together, spending
              time at each others places, would make them incredibly proud.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              Not many people are lucky enough to have a story like ours. It's
              definitely a unique one but a great one to tell. Usually people
              breakup and just leave it at that but I will always think about
              how incredible our story of how we got back together is
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I know this is a lot to read but I promise next time it won't be
              so long. It's just that we've gone through a lot by ourselves
              these last 6 years and this being the first time i get to make
              something like this for you I wanted to make it special because
              you deserve it.
            </p>

          <div class="letter__sub-container hidden" id="letter-seven">
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I want you to know now and forever you will never be alone Cassia.
              We've both had our fun during the time we spent apart but now that
              we're back together I'm ready for us. Everyday is a celebration
              knowing I got you. And you will always have me, I'm not going
              anywhere and I'm going to make sure I will keep you happy. There's
              nothing I want more to be the source of your joy as well as the
              one who wipes the tears off your face when you're down.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I want to be the one to hold you down no matter the situation. I'm
              prepared for whatever comes our way. And if we ever have days
              where we aren't in the best moods I'll make it an effort to ensure
              you that it's always love at the end of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              I have fallen in love with even what you call your flaws, and
              there aren't many. I love you as a whole. you are perfectly
              imperfect. I wouldn't want you any other way.There's nothing about
              you that I can say i don't like besdies you being sorry about
              stuff you shouldn't be sorry about. I guess that means you just
              have a big heart and it clearly shows
            </p>
            <p class="letter__text text">
              With all that being said I just wanna say Happy One Month baby.
              This may seem like a lot for just a one month anniversary but for
              you it still doesn't feel like enough. I still feel so lucky to
              say this everytime I say this but:
